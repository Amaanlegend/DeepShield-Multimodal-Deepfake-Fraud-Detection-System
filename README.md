DeepShield: Multimodal Deepfake & Fraud Detection System

Overview

DeepShield is an advanced deepfake detection system developed to identify manipulated media by analyzing audio, video, and images using cutting-edge machine learning techniques. The system combines CNN + LSTM models, blockchain technology for secure logging, and cloud-based services to create a scalable and robust solution that ensures real-time fraud prevention

DeepShield provides NatWest with a comprehensive fraud detection tool that is secure, scalable, and easy to integrate into existing systems. Its multimodal approach ensainst evolving fraud threats.ures robust protection ag

Features

Multimodal Deepfake Detection:

• CNN + LSTM model for deepfake detection in video streams.
• Audio analysis to detect speech pattern anomalies.
• Facial texture anomaly detection, analyzing skin texture and lighting irregularities.
• Facial landmark analysis to spot inconsistencies in muscle movements and facial features.

Biometric Cross-Verification:

• Facial & Voice Matching: Ensures consistency between voice and facial data with real-time cross-checking against pre-existing customer databases.
• Real-Time Verification: Ideal for sensitive use cases like KYC (Know Your Customer) verification in financial services or fraud prevention.

Blockchain Integration:

• Immutable Audit Log: Every deepfake detection and fraud prevention event is securely recorded on a blockchain ledger for transparency and legal reviews.
• Tamper Detection: Media file metadata (timestamps, geolocation, and device type) is checked for inconsistencies.

Cloud-Backed Processing:

• AWS Lambda & S3: DeepShield leverages AWS Lambda for processing and AWS S3 for storage, ensuring scalability and flexibility.

Evaluation Metrics:

• Standard metrics include Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
• Performance comparisons with traditional classifiers such as SVM and Random Forest are provided.

System Architecture

Input Layer
Supports multiple media formats: videos (MP4, AVI), images (JPG, PNG), and audio files (WAV, MP3).
Accepts live video stream URLs for real-time verification, perfect for use cases like live KYC checks.
Optional biometric inputs (facial images, voice recordings) for cross-verification with databases.

Core Modules

• Pre-Processing:

Metadata analysis for tamper detection.
Video stabilization and enhancement for optimal feature extraction.

• Deepfake Detection:

Deep learning models (trained on datasets like DFDC and FaceForensics++) to detect texture anomalies, facial landmark inconsistencies, and mismatches in audio-visual synchronization.

• Multimodal Fraud Detection:

Uses biometric cross-verification, along with contextual analysis based on user behavior patterns, geolocation, and recent transactions.

• Blockchain-Backed Logging:

Every detection is immutably logged on a blockchain for secure, verifiable audit trails.

Evaluation
DeepShield provides robust performance evaluation using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score.
